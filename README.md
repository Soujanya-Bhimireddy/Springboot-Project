# Student Management System

## Overview

This project, the Student Management System, was developed as a personal learning experience. It aims to simplify the management of student information, allowing for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on student records.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** The system supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting student records.
- **Spring Boot:** The backend of the system is built using the Spring Boot framework.
- **H2 Database:** Data storage is managed using the H2 Database.
- **RESTful Services:** The project includes RESTful services that provide easy integration and communication.
- **Annotations:** Extensive use of Spring Boot annotations such as `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, and `@Autowired` for efficient configuration and behavior management.
- **Postman Testing:** The system can be tested using Postman, a popular API testing tool.

## Development Environment

- **IDE:** Eclipse IDE was used for development.
- **API Testing:** Postman was used to test the functionality and interactions of the system.

## Learning Experience

This project was primarily undertaken to deepen the developer's understanding of web development, particularly focusing on RESTful services and Spring Boot. It also provided valuable hands-on practice with API testing and validation.

## Future Plans

While this project was initially developed for learning purposes, the skills acquired can be applied in a professional setting for building robust and user-friendly web applications.
